    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>As a passionate traveler and dedicated K-pop dancer, I have cultivated a diverse set of experiences that reflect my enthusiasm for exploring new cultures and expressing myself through dance. My travels have taken me across various continents, allowing me to immerse myself in the rich traditions and vibrant lifestyles of different countries.</p>

    <h2>Travel Experiences</h2>
    <p>I have explored numerous European countries, each offering unique landscapes and cultural experiences. My adventures extend to Asia, particularly Japan and South Korea, where I have engaged in trail running, hiking, and various adventure sports that challenge my limits and enhance my appreciation for nature.</p>

    <h2>K-Pop Dance Enthusiasm</h2>
    <p>As a K-pop dance enthusiast, I actively participate in workshops and performances that allow me to connect with fellow dancers and share our passion for this dynamic art form. My training has not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the cultural significance behind K-pop.</p>

    <h2>Culinary Interests</h2>
    <p>My culinary journey is equally enriching. I am a devoted fan of Japanese and South Korean vegetarian cuisine, relishing dishes such as <strong>kimchi</strong> and <strong>bibimbap</strong>. Additionally, as an Indian by birth, I hold a profound love for Indian cuisine, which serves as a comforting reminder of my roots.</p>
